		<h3>Brittany Hölljes about the song:</h3>
		<p>	"Ian began writing ‘Holding Onto Good’ how he writes most songs. A lyric and melody come to him, and he pursues it trying to tease out a story. Early on, he realized he was telling my story. Because we were all living together so close, we were talking constantly about our lives. We had the closeness. Ian tapped into my feelings and experience and started to create to music. It’s amazing and miraculous that he has that skill. I helped in the sense that I guided him as to when it felt real or true. Ultimately, he wrote it, and it’s wonderful I get to sing it. It’s also wonderful I have a brother who cares enough about my feelings to write about them.”</p>

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>	  
        <p>Baby, I'm not waiting</p>
        <p>I'm just holding on to good</p>
        <p>It's still early, it's still more than I should</p>
        <p>I'm off to Carolina</p>
        <p>I'm gonna wear my mama’s boots</p>
        <p>We may be parted, but that don't cut us at the roots</p>
        <p>'Cause in the morning, in the morning</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think about the way you held me</p>
        <p>In the morning, in the morning</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think about the way you held me</p>
        <p>It's colder in November</p>
        <p>The leaves are turning on the limbs</p>
        <p>The color’s brightest just before the branches thin</p>
        <p>And, yes, I still remember</p>
        <p>But I am trying to begin</p>
        <p>I met a new love and I’m growing into him</p>
        <p>But in the morning, in the morning</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think about the way you held me</p>
        <p>In the morning, in the morning</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think about the way you held me</p>
        <p>I see a new flag rising on an old flagpole</p>
        <p>A shotgun fired in the firing hole</p>
        <p>I’ll let the snow keep falling till my world is white</p>
        <p>I don’t need your hand tonight</p>
        <p>But in the morning, in the morning</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think about the way you held me</p>
