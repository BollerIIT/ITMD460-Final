		<h3>The Band on making this song</h3>
		<p>	“We don’t know if we’d still be a band if we hadn’t made this video.
Throughout 2017 and the start of 2018, Delta Rae was touring ceaselessly and we were about to hit the biggest wall of our careers. Our two singles at country radio hadn’t stuck, our longtime manager and friend decided to leave the band and the music industry, so we were managing ourselves, spread across the southeast and it was unclear what would happen next. It was a very difficult time.
As artists, when you hit a wall like that, there is only one way out — we needed to make something.
One of Eric’s best friends from college, Law Chen, is a genius filmmaker who directed our first music video for “Bottom of the River.” He’s always wanted to shoot a video in Iceland, so on a whim we booked the cheapest tickets we could find, story-boarded on the flight, and traveled around the gravel roads eating salami and cheese sandwiches in a rental car, pulling over to shoot when we saw something beautiful.
We’re gratefully unstuck, and really proud of the song and the video. We are still dreaming as big as ever, and hope this video will inspire everyone who sees it. If you’re following a dream, don’t give up."

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>	  
		<p>Do you ever dream?</p>
        <p>Do you ever see the future when you look at me?</p>
        <p>A little house in the mountains surrounded by the evergreens</p>
        <p>A homemade meal and a couple kids</p>	
        <p>Or is just the moment?</p>
        <p>Is it the sex and the comfort and the laughs that keep you coming back?</p>
        <p>I hate to ruin the romance baby but I have to ask</p>
        <p>Is there something I can't see?</p>
        <p>Do you ever dream?</p>
        <p>Do you ever dream?</p>
        <p>Or do you want to leave this world while you’re still young and free?</p>
        <p>Live on the edge and leave falling in love to girls like me</p>
        <p>And you'd give me just enough</p>
        <p>But you never call, you never share</p>
        <p>You're never wrong, and it’s not fair</p>
        <p>I had a vision of who I'd be</p>
        <p>And baby I'm not there</p>
        <p>Do you ever dream?</p>
        <p>Do you ever dream when the nights get lonely?</p>
        <p>You're gonna wish that I was there</p>
        <p>Do you ever dream how it's gonna hurt baby</p>
        <p>When there's nobody that cares</p>
        <p>About the stories that you tell?</p>
        <p>Do you even get that far?</p>
        <p>'Cause I've been living in this moment</p>
        <p>And it’s all falling apart</p>
        <p>Do you ever dream?</p>
        <p>Hold on to something you can’t see</p>
        <p>Give me a reason not to leave</p>
